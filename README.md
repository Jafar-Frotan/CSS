### Who
5
​
6
I'm Cassidy. I'm a engineer and I've been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and other web development and scripting for over 15 years.
7
And I want to teach you now.
8
Because you're good looking.
9
And because it's useful.

### What
12
​
13
In this tutorial, we'll start from the very beginning.  You don't need to know anything about HTML and CSS or anything about code to start.  I'll include some tutorial files for you to play with and check out.

15
### When
16
​
17
Now.  Or whenever.  I'm not planning on taking this down anytime soon.  But you are only limited by your own schedule.  Or set free by it.  Whatever.

### Where
20
​
21
On a computer.  Here.
22
​
23
### Why
24
​
25
Because this stuff is important.  Whether you're a business person formatting your emails, an aspiring web designer wanting to get your feet wet, or just someone who is interested and hasn't tried any sort of coding, scripting, or programming before, **HTML and CSS are an essential part** of your learning curve.
